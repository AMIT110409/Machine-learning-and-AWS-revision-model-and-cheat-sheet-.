Machine Learning

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

There are three main types of machine learning algorithms:

Supervised learning: Supervised learning algorithms are trained on a dataset of labeled data, where each input data point has a corresponding output value. The algorithm learns to predict the output value for new input data points by finding patterns in the training data.
Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained on a dataset of unlabeled data, where the input data points do not have corresponding output values. The algorithm learns to find patterns in the data and group similar data points together.
Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by trial and error. The algorithm interacts with an environment and receives rewards or punishments for its actions. The algorithm learns to take actions that maximize its rewards over time.
AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications.

AWS offers a variety of machine learning services, including:

Amazon SageMaker: SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service that makes it easy to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
Amazon Rekognition: Rekognition is an image and video analysis service that can identify objects, people, scenes, and text in images and videos.
Amazon Comprehend: Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that can identify and extract entities, key phrases, and sentiment from text.
Amazon Forecast: Forecast is a machine learning service that can be used to generate accurate forecasts for time series data.
